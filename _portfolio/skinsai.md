## Overview
SkinsAI is a free-access diagnostic tool that helps users classify moles as benign or malignant using deep learning. Developed during The Pitt Challenge Hackathon in Fall 2022.

## Problem
Early detection of melanoma is critical for successful treatment, but access to dermatologists can be limited. SkinsAI provides an accessible screening tool to help identify potentially dangerous moles.

## Solution
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Built and trained in PyTorch for image classification
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing mole images
- **Free Access**: No cost to users, democratizing skin cancer screening

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: PyTorch for model development
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture trained on medical imagery
- **Deployment**: Hosted web application

## Recognition
- **2nd place** out of 24 teams at The Pitt Challenge Hackathon
- Recognized for impact on healthcare accessibility

## Impact
SkinsAI demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to critical healthcare problems while maintaining accessibility. The tool helps users make informed decisions about seeking professional medical evaluation.

**Disclaimer**: This tool is meant for screening purposes only and should not replace professional medical diagnosis.
