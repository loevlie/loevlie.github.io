**Hi, my name is Denny!**  I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Tufts University, where I'm advised by **[Prof. Michael Hughes](https://www.michaelchughes.com/)** and **[Prof. Jivko Sinapov](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jsinapov/)**.

I am broadly interested in deep learning with constraint. That constraint could be a lack of labeled data, quality data, rich data representations, or inherent model limitations.  

To address these constraints, I have explored diverse approaches including:

-  Transfer learning 
-  Weakly-supervised methods like multiple instance learning
-  Reinforcement learning for LLM post-training
-  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA
-  Simulation-to-real transfer
- Incorporating inductive biases inspired by cognitive science.

I am also interested in **deep learning interpretability** because as these models become ubiquitous in daily life, understanding their
  decision-making is essential for safe deployment.

My previous work spans medical imaging, computer vision for robotics, vision-language models, and computational chemistry.
