I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Tufts University, where I research data-efficient machine learning methods with applications to computer vision and medical imaging. My work is driven by a core belief: **the most elegant solutions in machine learning often emerge from constraint, not abundance**.

## Research

I'm currently working on two main research projects at Tufts:

**Medical AI with Prof. Michael Hughes**
I'm developing deep learning methods for early detection of dementia and stroke from brain scans (MRI and CT). Using multiple instance learning (MIL), a weakly-supervised approach, we can train models with only patient-level diagnoses rather than expensive slice-by-slice annotations. My recent paper at ML4H 2025 reveals generalization gaps in current MIL architectures and establishes optimal performance bounds using synthetic datasets.

**Vision-Language Models with Prof. Jivko Sinapov**
I'm applying reinforcement learning techniques to improve VLMs' visual reasoning capabilities. Recent projects include using group relative policy optimization to improve LLM SVG generation (18% improvement) and developing a psychology-inspired approach to object counting that treats it as a sequential task where models learn optimal scanning trajectories.

## Background

Before Tufts, I worked as a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at KEF Robotics, where I led the development of multi-modal semantic segmentation for autonomous drone navigation. I designed a three-stage pipeline combining transfer learning, domain adaptation, and cross-modal label transfer to detect power lines across RGB and infrared modalities with minimal labeled data.

Earlier in my career, I published several papers in computational chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, including a first-author paper in *Accounts of Chemical Research* that achieved a 71% reduction in prediction error for multimetallic nanoparticle properties.

## Research Interests

- Data-efficient machine learning (transfer learning, few-shot learning, weakly-supervised methods)
- Medical image analysis and multiple instance learning
- Vision-language models and multimodal learning
- Reinforcement learning for LLM post-training
- Computer vision applications in robotics

## Education

- **M.S. in Computer Science**, Tufts University (2024-2026, expected)
- **M.S. in Chemical Engineering**, Carnegie Mellon University (2020)
- **B.S. in Chemical Engineering**, West Virginia University (2019)

The thread connecting my work—from molecular modeling to drone navigation to medical AI and LLM post-training—is the conviction that constraint breeds innovation. Whether it's limited labeled data, noisy annotations, or inherent model limitations, I'm passionate about developing methods that push the boundaries of what's possible with less.
